# Question mysql to pg

use pgloader to transfer data from MySQL to an existing Postgres database, with a given file showing the correspondence between fields.

# Answer

Sure, I can help you with that. To transfer data from MySQL to an existing Postgres database, you'll need to use the pgloader command. You'll need to provide the pgloader command with the source and target databases, as well as the file that shows the correspondence between fields. 

For example, if you have a MySQL database called `my_db` and a Postgres database called `postgres_db`, you can use the following command to transfer the data:

```
pgloader mysql://user:password@host/my_db postgresql://user:password@host/postgres_db file.sql
```

# Question

how do i match fields ?

# Answer

To match fields, you'll need to create a file that contains the mapping between the fields in the MySQL database and the fields in the Postgres database. This file should be in SQL format and should include the names of the fields and the data types. For example, if you have a field called `name` in the MySQL database and a field called `full_name` in the Postgres database, the file should look like this:

```
CREATE TABLE mapping (
  name VARCHAR(255),
  full_name VARCHAR(255)
);
```

Once you have created the file, you can use it with the pgloader command to transfer the data.

# Question

can i do it for severaol tables in once ?

# Answer

Yes, you can transfer data from multiple tables in one go. You'll need to create a separate mapping file for each table, and then use the `--mapping-files` option with the pgloader command to specify the files. For example, if you have two tables called `table1` and `table2`, you can use the following command to transfer the data:

```
pgloader mysql://user:password@host/my_db postgresql://user:password@host/postgres_db --mapping-files table1.sql table2.sql
```
